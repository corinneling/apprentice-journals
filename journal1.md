# All the Feels
I was equally excited and freaked out the first day. Realizing there was so much time management wasn’t as big of a deal, as I have had to manage my own time everyday for the past couple of years. The real kicker was the level that everyone, including Travis and Yosevu are already at. I feel like they might even end up mentoring me. I still think there must have been a mix up. I mean, there has to be a karen ling or a corinne smith out there, and gmail autocorrected it to my email address when they sent the congrats email. At that point it was too late, and they were stuck with me.

I’ve got two options though, keep focusing on how much more experience and skill everyone else has, or I can do something about it.

I think I need to start keeping my ‘believe in yourself!’ journal again.
When I first started web design I had major imposter syndrome. The combination of not having a CS degree and that I was one of the only women developers in Reno led to some confidence issues and a surprising amount of push back from clients and other developers. But one day, I read a blog post about this woman engineer who graduated from harvard and works at nasa, or something crazy like that. I clearly remember being impressed by her credentials and shocked that she would have imposters syndrome.

Anyways, everyday she would document anytime anyone gave her a compliment on her job performance or quality of work. She’d write down what they said and the person who said it. From the smallest thank you to the biggest job review.

I did that for a couple weeks a while after I started working in Reno and it helped a ton! I think if I try doing that (especially since everyone is so authentically positive here!) it will help.

As far as the pairing, I think I just have to do it. There’s no way I can get over my introverted fear of striking up a conversation with someone who I don’t know. So I just have to force myself to do it at least once a day so I start feeling comfortable with it. I did that yesterday with Katy, who I already know through GDI. Even though I feel comfortable talking with her it still felt good to know I asked for help and it wasn’t earth-shatteringly embarrassing. I’m hoping that in this process, I will gain the confidence to approach people and reach out to others on a day to day basis, both within and outside of this office.
