# Learn Through Mistakes

The hot dog stand project has been so helpful. Most of the tutorials and exercises that I have been working on with Ruby have consisted of 'Copy this code and run it'. So, it has been nice to work on a project that had no pre-existing code, and just a document that explained the required features and goals.

I started off not understanding OOP, and so far I've created a working hot dog stand with classes, and modules, and instances, and it is really cool to see.

Most of the project was made up of me having no idea where to start on something. Then working on tutorials, pairing with people, and eventually coming to a solution. Then that would lead to refactoring, and the process would repeat. That was perfect because being challenged every step of the way has been really helpful with learning how OOP and Ruby works.

I've still only touched the surface of writing tests because I keep getting distracted by Ruby in general. My plan for next week is to set Ruby aside for the most part, and focus on TDD. It would be nice to have a project like the hot dog stand but for TDD. I think I am going to start the hot dog stand from scratch, so I can better understand testing.
