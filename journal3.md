# Long Week
### General
This week feels like it’s been long, in that way when you can’t believe where you were a few days ago compared to now. I can’t imagine what it will be like in a month.

While I don’t even understand Ruby as much as I would like to, I still feel like I have been able to learn so much more than I expected to this week.

Going into this week I was determined to blaze through all of the tutorials, master ruby, and have a project I could tackle. Although, after so much reading, note taking, and copying code blocks, the content started to go through one ear and out the other. Some of the content had soaked in, but there was only so much I could read and digest.

Being able to work on a project, especially one I could collaborate on with Yosevu and Travis, helped me to understand Ruby so much more. It was so rewarding to be able to set up a program that worked, to be able to fix a couple of bugs, and get feedback from Travis and Yosevu. While, I am struggling with grasping the OOP theory, I know that will eventually click like the functionality and hot dog program did.
And honestly pairing has helped me so much. I feel much better about asking for help, maybe not running around the office asking for it, but seeing someone in the Chill Area or their office hours in the calendar makes it really easy to bring up a problem.

### Thoughts on Readings & Exercises
I think it would have helped if I had started with ‘Learn Ruby the Hard Way’. The content was so concise and running the example code blocks really helped me to understand concepts. I also wished I had started with the Object Oriented Section of the book. That’s what I really need to click, which is what I’m focusing on now.

Why’s Poignant Guide to Ruby was a great read, but I don’t think I retained as much of the information as I did with the other readings, because his writing style was so entertaining and funny I got distracted by the long, random story-telling sections and comics. I definitely enjoyed it, and if I had to do it again I would still read it, but maybe not as an introduction to Ruby.

I’m still working through Ruby Bits, and I have a feeling it will help a lot, since even the items brought up in the second lesson have not been touched on in any of the other content I’ve gone through.
