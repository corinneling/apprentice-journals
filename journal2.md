# Gists and Goals
### Gists
I've decided that from now on I will make a gist every time I get through a task or solve a problem. I did this after Gary helped me sync my forked repo with the original repo I was working from. It really helped me get my thoughts in order, and gave me ease of mind to know I have something to look back on if I run into the same problem.
Below are the two gists I've created so far.

### Goals
Besides that I have been focusing on pairing this week. It's still terrifying, but I am going with my original plan: ask people to pair until it doesn't freak me out anymore.

I've also altered my perspective on it slightly, after Yosevu mentioned he was viewing pairing as a time to build relationships as well as learn. I thought that was a really cool insight, which might be obvious to most, but still really helped me out.

Pairing with people after that helped to solidify that perspective. I was able to talk with Bryan about the web developer industry and gain some insight from his experiences at SparkBox as well as other points in his career. Then Cat really gave me more awareness on the purpose of the apprenticeship as well as some helpful tips that will help me day to day. I figure learning isn't just about functions and theory. It can be about hearing other's experiences and gaining insight from them.
