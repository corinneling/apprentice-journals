# More Than One Way

This week I focused on testing, and instead of creating the same application I decided to change the content and the structure.

It was slightly overwhelming starting a project with nothing but a test folder set up. I think the biggest challenge involving that was figuring out what needed testing, and how to translate what I wanted the program to do into tests.

In the end, it was really helpful to start that way since I was able to discard any unnecessary aspects of the program. Also, it was a very helpful way of approaching code that wasn't working at first. In the first hot dog stand program, I would get stuck on a method if it wasn't working, but with the test driven development I was able to tell myself to move on and take a different approach.

It was also really cool looking into setting up test coverage and being able to see feedback from Code Climate, SimpleCov, and Travis CI.
